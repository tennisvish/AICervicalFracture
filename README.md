I used data from RSNA 2022 Cervical Spine Fracture Detection
For training your own model
  collect DCM files and organize them by patient UID
  then place relevant images in that folder
  there should also bs acsv with labeles for patient overlal fracture and vertebra level fracture (1 for fracture, 0 for none)
For Visualization with Gradio
